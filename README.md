# PaperSoccer
Creating a player vs player and player vs AI competitive game. I implemented the Minimax algorithm for the AI, where the utilityis to get
closer to the opponent's goal using some useful rules. You can't go on an edge that already has been visited. But going on a visited point
or a point on the wall will give you another round. 
UI implementation is by Java Swing.
