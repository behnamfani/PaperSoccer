Creating a player vs player and player vs AI competitive game using Minimax algorithm. I implemented the Minimax algorithm for the AI, where the utilities to get
closer to the opponent's goal using some useful rules. You can't go on an edge that already has been visited. But going on a visited point
or a point on the wall will give you another round. Thus, in each round, AI trys to find best possible move to get closer to the player's goal.

UI implementation is by Java Swing.
